To allow humans or AI players to interact with our model, we can design a user-player interface with
behaviors to play the game, such as drawing the next card from the deck and removing a card from
their hand. In addition, we would also have a behavior to calculate the best card to play.
In the AI player object, this behavior would involve an algorithm that should calculate the next
move by computing all possible next to maximize the potential points and decide whether to place a
card or pass.
